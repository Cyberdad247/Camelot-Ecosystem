# [BOOTSTRAP CLASS]: FULLSTACK_BAREMETAL_CUBE

# CONTRACT: Post-conditions, not attempts.
#
# Every phase in this file ends by asserting an OUTCOME. Nothing is allowed to fail
# quietly. The previous revision was almost entirely `|| true` — including PHASE 5,
# which enables the always-on daemons:
#
#     sudo systemctl enable --now camelot-heimdall-bifrost \
#                              camelot-hermes-prime \
#                              camelot-vps-mesh \
#                              caddy || true
#
# That line meant "try four things and report nothing", and it is why the hub ran
# for weeks with `caddy` absent, three camelot units `disabled`, and a
# `camelot-hermes-prime.service` that was switched off with a `--loop` flag the
# engine rejects outright. The banner still said "FORGED & SOVEREIGN", because the
# banner was a print statement, not a result.
#
# Post-conditions here describe OUTCOMES, not implementations:
#   * "something serves :80" instead of "caddy is running" — nginx serves the hub,
#     and asserting caddy would have failed a host that is actually fine.
#   * "the unit is enabled AND active" instead of "enable --now returned".
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/vps_hub_bootstrap.sh               # apply, then verify (mutates)
#   bash scripts/vps_hub_bootstrap.sh --apply       # same, explicit
#   bash scripts/vps_hub_bootstrap.sh --self-check  # verify only, NO mutation
#
# `--self-check` audits an existing host read-only. Exit code is 0 only if every
# REQUIRED post-condition holds. Use it to catch drift after the fact, which is the
# thing the old `|| true` made impossible.

# --- Alert channel: wiring is assertable, delivery is not --------------------------------
# Whether a message reaches a human depends on an external provider, so no local command can
# prove it. What CAN be asserted is that the wiring exists. `sendmail` returning 0 means only
# that the MTA ACCEPTED the message — the live test bounced minutes later with
# `Action: failed / Status 5.0.0` while the channel had reported success — which is why an
# unconfigured channel is a WARNING here and not a pretended PASS.
